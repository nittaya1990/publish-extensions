## How to Add an Extension?

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (we use Node 18)
-   Ubuntu Linux (Windows and macOS work fine for adding extensions, but extensions are always tested on Ubuntu, so they only need to build correctly there)

To add an extension to this repo, clone the repo[^clone], install the dependencies[^deps], and use the following command:

```bash
node add-extension.js ext.id https://github.com/x/y --optional arg
```

Or, if the extension you want to add exists on the MS Marketplace[^ms], you can simply feed the script the item URL (this automatically populates both the ID and git repository).

```bash
node add-extension.js https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ext.id --optional arg
```

All of the arguments are also valid options if you add the extension manually to the JSON file directly. You can find them in the [extension-schema.json file](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/HEAD/extensions-schema.json).

See [Publishing options](#publishing-options) below for a quick guide.

⚠️ Some extensions require additional build steps, and failing to execute them may lead to a broken extension published to Open VSX. Please check the extension's `scripts` section in the package.json file to find such steps; usually they are named `build` or similar. In case the build steps are included in the [vscode:prepublish](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prepublish-step) script, they are executed automatically, so it's not necessary to mention them explicitly. Otherwise, please include them in the `prepublish` value, e.g. `"prepublish": "npm run build"`.

Click the button below to start a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace where you can run the scripts contained in this repository:

## Publishing Options

The best way to add an extension here is to [open this repository in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions) and [add a new entry to `extensions.json`](#how-to-add-an-extension).

To test, run:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_pat EXTENSIONS=rebornix.ruby SKIP_PUBLISH=true node publish-extensions.js
```

### `GITHUB_TOKEN`

For testing locally, we advise you to provide a [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) for release and file resolution in our scripts. Otherwise, publishing can work in our workflow but fail for you locally and vice-a-versa.

You can create one in your [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens). This token does not require any special permissions.

```jsonc
    // Unique Open VSX extension ID in the form "<publisher>.<name>"
    "rebornix.ruby": {
      // Repository URL to clone and publish from. If the extension publishes `.vsix` files as release artifacts, this will determine the repo to fetch the releases from.
      "repository": "https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml"
    },
```

## How do extensions get updated?

The publishing job auto infers the latest version published to the MS Marketplace[^ms] using [`vsce`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vsce) and then tries to resolve a `vsix` file using a [GitHub Release asset](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) or, when one doesn't exist, it tries to find a commit to a build associated with the version using tags and commits around the last MS Marketplace[^ms] updated date.

## How are Extensions Published?

Every night (Monday-Friday) at [03:03 UTC](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/a95d871811e490e1d24fd233b4047cac03f293a2/.github/workflows/publish-extensions.yml#L6), a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/a95d871811e490e1d24fd233b4047cac03f293a2/.github/workflows/publish-extensions.yml#L25-L68) goes through all entries in [`extensions.json`](./extensions.json), and checks for every entry whether it needs to be published to https://open-vsx.org or not (whether it is up-to-date).

The [publishing process](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/master/publish-extension.js) can be summarized like this:

1. [`git clone "repository"`](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/a0fa4378a6621fb4d660a3bc7cefe71e074c077f/lib/resolveExtension.js#L53)

If a `custom` property is provided, then every command from the array is executed. Otherwise, the following 2 steps are executed: (steps 4 and 5 are executed in both cases)

2. [`npm install`](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/a0fa4378a6621fb4d660a3bc7cefe71e074c077f/publish-extension.js#L56) (or `yarn install` if a `yarn.lock` file is detected in the repository)
3. _([`"prepublish"`](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/fcf903b3a3d7df1c7f7bc7ce20f21b8a9d49e5d4/publish-extension.js#L79))_
4. _([`ovsx create-namespace "publisher"`](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/fcf903b3a3d7df1c7f7bc7ce20f21b8a9d49e5d4/publish-extension.js#L135-L140) if it doesn't already exist)_
5. [`ovsx publish`](https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions/blob/fcf903b3a3d7df1c7f7bc7ce20f21b8a9d49e5d4/publish-extension.js#L142) (with `--yarn` if a `yarn.lock` file was detected earlier)

See all `ovsx` CLI options [here](https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/blob/master/cli/README.md).

## Environment Variables

Custom commands such as `prepublish` and the ones inside the `custom`-array receive a few environment variables
in order to perform advanced tasks such as executing operations based on the extension version.

Following environment variables are available:

-   `EXTENSION_ID`: the extension ID, e.g. `rebornix.ruby`
-   `EXTENSION_PUBLISHER`: the extension publisher, e.g. `rebornix`
-   `EXTENSION_NAME`: the extension name, e.g. `ruby`
-   `VERSION`: the version of the extension to publish, e.g. `0.1.0`
-   `MS_VERSION`: the latest version of the extension on the MS Marketplace[^ms], e.g. `0.1.0`
-   `OVSX_VERSION`: the latest version of the extension on Open VSX, e.g. `0.1.0`
